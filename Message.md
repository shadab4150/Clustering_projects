Hey Reader, 


Hope you are healthy and doing well.
I want to say that cases have been rising at peak level in the national capital.


In this peak pandemic delhi government run IPU university has decided to take offline exams, on just 5 days notice. 
About 30 % students live outside delhi in other states, how can they come at such short notice? 


**Also Many students suffer from asthma, one of friends has a rare disease he is on blood thinners, so people like him contracting covid can be deathly.**

Some students and their families are in quarantine, some are covid positive.
We just want exams to be done in a safe manner for both teacher and students. 
**Many states have adopted unique online ways of conducting exams.**


**Supreme Court has given complete autonomy to states to conduct exams,either online, open book, assignment based, any safe medium.**


**My father lost his job during lockdown, we have to move to our village from delhi.I live with 6 members of my family in a rented 2BHK house in Siddharth Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. 
My grandmother is diabetic, sir how I am to afford travel and lodging in delhi in this financial strained year.**

**Most students from Delhi government run colleges , come from financially weak backgrounds or are out of state.**


Many of us tried real hard to convey our problems regarding whether offline examinations are safe when the number of covid positive cases each day are crossing 90,000 now. 


University has not reached a single student. It's not like jee mains. We have to come to college at 7:30 am sharp every day for 10 days, When transport is a major problem.


**I beg you to please support us on twitter on contact authorities because they are not even listening to us.**  

I Have emailed every member of Delhi constituent assembly, and university officials, No one is replying to us. 

They are not even giving proper guidelines, regarding syllabus , exam paper patter, marks anything. 
I know you have more pressing things to do.But I beg you to please just support us. 

We just want a safe environment to give exams. 

Warm Regards,
shadab sayeed
